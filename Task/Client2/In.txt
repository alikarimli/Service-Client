As the speed and ease-of-use 
of GUIs applications 
have improved over time, 
the use of console applications
has greatly diminished, but not disappeared. 
Some users simply prefer console based applications, 
while some organizations still rely on
existing console 
applications to handle 
key data processing 
tasks.
